## ü¶∏ Features

-   Based on [zxcvbn-ts](https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/).
-   Password strength is labeled as 'Weak', 'Could be stronger' and 'Strong'.
-   Customizable display modes.
-   Compatible with `nearata/flarum-ext-signup-confirm-password`.

## üì• Installation

```bash
composer require glowingblue/password-strength:*
```

## ‚ôª Updating

```bash
composer update glowingblue/password-strength
php flarum cache:clear
```

## üö´ Conflicts

-   `glowingblue/password-strength` doesn't work with `therealsujitk/flarum-ext-show-password` which
    can be removed, as `glowingblue/password-strength` adds a very similar functionality.

## üìñ Usage

Just enable the extension and customize if you wish.

## üìù To-do

-   I have no idea about how to implement it inside the reset password blade but you're very welcome
    to guide me or open a pull request on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/glowingblue/flarum-ext-password-strength).
